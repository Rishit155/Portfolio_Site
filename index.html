              <p>MI Technical Solutions</p>
              <p>July 2021</p>
              <p>I got the opportunity to work in their major areas of work: 3D modeling and designing, networking, and cybersecurity.  I was assigned the task to build a device that I would attach to their underwater ROV that would serve a relevant purpose in real life problem.  Through tinker cad, I designed a device which would collect soil samples from the bottom of the water body and 3D printed the design.  We got to test out my production in a river nearby, and it failed; however, we learned that the flaw in design was its weak structure causing it to break eventually after getting hit multiple times.  I also got certified in packet tracer and had to implement my knowledge by creating networks for the office environments.  I learned how to build a LAMP server, which we got to implement by building a server for their project known as Avia Vestigo.</p>
